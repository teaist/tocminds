      How the new rewards system works
    </h3>
    <p>
      Minds rewards you with crypto for contributing to the network. The first
      step in joining our rewards program is to provide your mobile number. We
      convert your number into a hash ID using SHA-256 encryption and a salt key
      to create a unique identifier for your account. We do not store your
      number on our servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than rewarding you with Points in real-time, we are now
      distributing our crypto rewards as a “Daily Reward Pool”. During the test
      network, we will be experimenting with how the Daily Reward Pool is
      calculated, but it will ideally be automated based on user participation
      once we move into the Main Ethereum network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day, we measure your contributions to the network and you receive a
      “Contribution Score” which can be found in the Contributions section of
      your wallet. We then calculate how much you contributed to the network
      relative to the entire community, which determines the percentage of the
      Daily Reward Pool that you earn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that with the new system, you will only receive
      credit for unique interaction, and you can only earn credit from another
      unique user once per metric per day. (If a friend votes on my content 100
      times in a day, I will only get credit for 1 vote). This is critical in
      preventing gaming and abuse of the system as we move into more valuable
      token rewards. We are essentially measuring how many unique users you
      reached in a given day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daily rewards will be distributed at 02:00 am GMT everyday into your
      OffChain address.

      How we measure your contributions
    </h3>
    <p>
      We calculate your
      <a routerLink="/wallet/tokens/contributions">contribution score</a> each
      day using the following weighted scoring system. Please note that the new
      system only gives credit for unique engagement (users who have provided a
      mobile number), so not all engagement you receive will be factored into
      your score.

      OnChain vs. Offchain
    </h3>
    <p>
      OffChain tokens are stored on Minds servers, and they can be used the same
      way that you used your Points. There are no fees, and they can be used to
      Boost content for more views from the network or to Wire other creators
      who you support.
    </p>
    <p>
      You now have the ability to withdraw these tokens into your OnChain
      address.
    </p>
    <p>
      OnChain tokens are stored on the
      <a href="https://ethereum.org" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> public
      blockchain and are accessible from outside of the Minds platform, which is
      key for further decentralization. OnChain transactions, however, require a
      small Ethereum “gas” fee, which is the incentive for the Ethereum miners
      to process the transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      For OnChain configuration, you have the ability to use MetaMask (a browser
      plugin), your mobile device, an existing Ethereum address or you can
      create your own with Minds. We recommend using MetaMask for the most
      seamless user experience. You can change this address by clicking on the
      <a routerLink="/wallet/tokens/addresses">"Addresses"</a> tab on the wallet
      menu
